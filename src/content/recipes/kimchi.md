## Ingredients

- **1 head Chinese cabbage** (Napa cabbage, chopped into bite-sized pieces)
- **1 medium Carrot** (julienned)
- **1 small Onion** (thinly sliced)
- **2 cloves Garlic** (minced)
- **1-2 fresh chillies**, chopped
- **1 tbsp Ginger** (grated)
- **2 tbsp Himalayan Natural Mineral Salt**

## Instructions

1. **Sterilizing**
    - Sterilize your jar by rinsing it with boiling water before filling it.
2. **Salt the Cabbage**
    - In a large bowl, toss the chopped cabbage with the Himalayan salt.
    - Let it sit for about **2 hours**, massaging occasionally to help draw out moisture.
    - Rinse the cabbage **thoroughly** in cold water to remove excess salt, then drain well.
3. **Prepare the Kimchi Paste**
    - In a separate bowl, mix the **chilli, garlic, ginger, and onion** until combined.
    - If needed, add a small amount of water to form a paste.
4. **Combine Ingredients**
    - Add the **rinsed cabbage and carrot** to the bowl with the paste.
    - Mix everything thoroughly, using gloves to coat the vegetables evenly.
5. **Fermentation**
    - Pack the kimchi into a clean glass jar, pressing down to remove air pockets. Ensure all vegetables are fully submerged in their own juices or a small amount of extra brine (saltwater).
    - Leave about **1 inch of space at the top** to allow for expansion.
    - Seal loosely and let it ferment at **room temperature (65-75°F)** for **2-5 days**.
    - Taste daily; when it reaches your desired tanginess, move it to the fridge.

*if you don’t have enough brine: **Mix 1 cup (240 ml) of water** with **1 tablespoon of sea salt** 


### **Storage & Serving:**

- Store in the fridge for **several weeks to months**.
- Serve as a side dish, in stir-fries, or with rice.
