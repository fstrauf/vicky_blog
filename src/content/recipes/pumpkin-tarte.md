### Puff Pastry

- 166 a**ll-purpose flour**, plus more for generously flouring hands, surface, and dough
- 1 teaspoon **granulated sugar**
- 1/2 teaspoon **salt**
- 170g **unsalted butter**, very cold and cubed
- 6–8 Tablespoons (90-120ml) **ice cold water**

**Make the Dough:**

1. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. Add cold, cubed butter and gently toss with your hands, lightly rubbing to start combining—keep butter in chunks. (Don’t use a processor or mixer; warm butter = sticky dough.) Add ice-cold water 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with your hands after each addition. Start squeezing the dough together after about 4 tablespoons. Stop when it forms a shaggy clump (usually around 6 tablespoons). If it feels wet before that, your butter was too warm. Turn dough out onto a floured surface. Pat into a 3/4–1 inch thick rectangle (about 5×8 inches). Fold into thirds like a letter. Flatten any cracks and wrap tightly.
2. **1st Chill:** Refrigerate for at least 2 hours (up to 24).
3. **Roll & Fold:** Let rest 5 minutes if too firm. On a floured surface, roll into a 6×12-inch rectangle, 1/2 inch thick. Fold into thirds, rotate, and repeat. Do this roll-fold-rotate cycle **6 times total**.
4. **2nd Chill:** Wrap tightly and refrigerate at least 15 minutes (or up to 24 hours). Can be frozen at this point.
5. Roll out and top with toppings.
6. Preheat oven to 200 C. Bake for 20–22 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown all over.
