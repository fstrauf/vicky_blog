## Ingredients

- 2 cups red onions, sliced
- 1 cup organic apple cider vinegar
- 1 cup water
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 tsp black peppercorns
- 1 tsp mustard seeds (optional)
- 1 bay leaf (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the onions**: Peel and trim the onions. If they’re large, you can slice them into rings.
2. **Boil the brine**: In a saucepan, combine vinegar, water, and salt. Bring to a boil.
3. **Pack the jar**: Place onions in a clean jar, adding spices, garlic, and bay leaf if using.
4. **Pour the brine**: Carefully pour the hot vinegar mixture over the onions, ensuring they are fully submerged.
5. **Seal and store**: Let the jar cool, then seal and refrigerate. They will develop flavor in about 24 hours and improve over a few days.
