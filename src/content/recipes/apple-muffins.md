**Prep time:** ~10 min


**Bake time:** ~20–25 min (muffins) or 30–35 min (small loaf)


**Oven temp:** **175°C (350°F)**


### Ingredients

- 1–2 bananas, mashed (200-250 g)
- 2 large eggs
- 90 g unsweetened applesauce
- **15–30 g melted coconut oil** (optional but recommended)
- 100 g almond flour
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp cinnamon
- ¼ tsp salt
- Add ins: 1 small apple finely diced, 2-4 tbsp raisins, chopped walnuts

### **Instructions:**

1. **Preheat the oven** to **175°C (350°F)**.

    Line a muffin tray with paper liners or grease lightly with oil.


    (You can also use a small loaf pan — just bake a bit longer.)

2. **Mash the bananas** well in a bowl.

    If underripe, roast or microwave them first (as noted earlier).

3. **Add wet ingredients**:
    - Eggs
    - Applesauce
    - Melted coconut oil (15–30 g)

    Mix until smooth.

4. **Add dry ingredients**:
    - Almond flour
    - Baking powder
    - Baking soda
    - Cinnamon
    - Salt

    Stir until just combined. Don’t overmix — it’s okay if it’s a bit lumpy.

5. **Fill muffin cups** about ¾ full.
6. **Bake** for:
    - **20–25 minutes** for muffins
    - **30–35 minutes** for a loaf

        Check with a toothpick — it should come out clean or with just a few moist crumbs.

7. **Cool** in the tin for 5–10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.
