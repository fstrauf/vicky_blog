## Ingredients

- 240g roasted pumpkin
- 200g roasted and mashed sweet potato
- 95g almond meal
- 95g whole wheat flour
- 2 large eggs
- 60g unsweetened applesauce + 2 more Tbsp
- 60ml melted coconut oil
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/8 tsp ground cloves (optional)
- Optional: 60g chopped walnuts, pecans, or unsweetened coconut

### Flavor Boosters:

- **Add orange zest (½–1 tsp)** to enhance the warming spices and sweetness naturally.
- A tablespoon of **maple syrup or honey** can boost flavor without overwhelming sweetness, if dietary needs allow.

## Instructions

- **Preheat oven** to **175°C** (350°F).
- **Mix Wet Ingredients:**
In a large bowl, whisk together:
    - Roasted pumpkin purée
    - Mashed sweet potato
    - Eggs
    - Applesauce
    - Oil
    - Vanilla extract
- **Mix Dry Ingredients:**
In another bowl, whisk together:
    - Almond meal
    - Whole wheat flour (or oat flour)
    - Baking soda
    - Baking powder
    - Salt
    - Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cloves
- **Combine:**

    Fold dry ingredients into wet ingredients until just combined. Stir in any optional add-ins (nuts, coconut).

- **Pour the batter** into the prepared round cake tin. Smooth the top with a spatula.
- **Bake:**

    Bake in the center of the oven for about **50–70 minutes**. Start checking after **50 minutes** by inserting a toothpick — it should come out with a few moist crumbs. If it's still wet, bake for another 10-15 minutes.

- **Cool:**

    Allow it to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out and let it cool completely on a wire rack.
