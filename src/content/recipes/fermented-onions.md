## Ingredients

- 2 cups small onions (peeled) or sliced red onions
- 2 cups filtered water (non-chlorinated)
- 1 tbsp sea salt (non-iodized)
- 1 tsp mustard seeds (optional)
- 1 tsp black peppercorns
- 2 cloves garlic (optional, for extra flavor)
- 1 bay leaf (optional, helps keep onions crisp)

### **Instructions:**

1. **Dissolve the salt** in the filtered water to create a brine.
2. **Pack the jar** – Add onions, spices, and garlic into a clean glass jar.
3. **Pour the brine** over the onions, ensuring they are fully submerged. Use a fermentation weight or a small clean glass to keep them down.
4. **Cover** – Use a loose lid or a cloth secured with a rubber band to allow gases to escape.
5. **Ferment** – Leave at room temperature (65-75°F) for 5–7 days. Taste after 3–4 days; continue fermenting until desired tanginess is reached.
6. **Store** – Once ready, seal with a tight lid and refrigerate. They’ll keep for months and continue developing flavor.

### **Notes:**

- A **bubbly or slightly cloudy** brine is normal during fermentation.
- If mold appears, skim it off and make sure everything stays submerged.
- You can add **sliced chili, ginger, or dill** for different variations.
