## Ingredients

- 140g almond flour
- 40g (heaping ⅓ cup) unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 tsp baking soda

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 175°C (350°F). Grease a loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.
2. **Mash bananas** in a large bowl. Whisk in eggs, melted butter, and vanilla extract.
3. **In another bowl**, whisk together almond flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
4. **Fold dry into wet** until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips and any add-ins.
5. **Pour into loaf pan**, spreading the batter evenly.
6. **Bake 35–45 minutes**, or until a toothpick comes out with just a few moist crumbs.
7. **Cool completely** in the pan before slicing—this makes it extra fudgy.
