## Ingredients


### Cake

- 3 eggs
- 220 g Medjool dates _, pitted (8 ounces)_
- 59 ml water
- 260 g [**almond butter**](https://detoxinista.com/how-to-make-homemade-almond-butter/) _(or nut butter of choice)_
- 1 teaspoon [**vanilla extract**](http://amzn.to/2qP6I1K)
- 3/4 teaspoon [**baking soda**](http://amzn.to/2qPbEn7)
- 1/4 teaspoon [**salt**](http://amzn.to/2rdmIuj)

### Icing

- 227 g Medjool dates _, pitted (8 ounces; 227 grams)_
- 240 g coconut cream _(the solid part in a chilled can of full-fat coconut milk)_
- 24 g [**cacao powder**](http://amzn.to/2xwgLJi) _, or more to taste (24 grams)_
- 2 g [**vanilla extract**](http://amzn.to/2qP6I1K) _(optional)_
- pinch of salt
- 15 g water _, if needed for blending (you can use the liquid leftover from the coconut milk can)_

## Instructions


### Cake

1. Preheat oven to 175 C and grease two 8-inch round pans, or three 6-inch pans, with coconut oil or spray oil. (I like to line them with parchment paper, too, to guarantee easy removal later.)
2. In a blender or food processor, combine the eggs, dates, and water and blend until smooth. (If using the food processor, I like to start with only the water because it can splash so much. Add in the eggs once the dates have broken down a bit, to avoid splashing.)
3. Add in the almond butter, vanilla, baking soda, and salt and blend again until a smooth batter is formed. Alternatively, you can pour the blended date mixture into a large bowl, then stir in the other ingredients, so your blender won't have to blend anything too thick.
4. Divide the batter among the two or three prepared pans, and smooth the top with a spatula. (They won't be very full, but will rise as they bake.) Bake until lightly golden on top, about 25 minutes to 30 minutes.
5. Cool completely before removing the cake from the pan, then frost with your favorite frosting and serve. This cake can be served and stored at room temperature for at least 2 days, but for best shelf life I recommend storing it in the fridge, tightly covered, for up to a week.

### Icing

1. First, melt the coconut cream so that it's liquid. (You want the cream chilled solid first so that you can separate it from the liquid in a can of coconut milk, but then you want to melt it so that it's liquid in the blender.) I melt the coconut cream using a double boiler, but you can most likely use a microwave to do this, if you prefer.
2. Add in the melted coconut cream, dates, cacao powder, vanilla, and salt to a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until silky smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides of the machine to keep everything moving, or use a tamper for the blender if you have one.
3. Add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water, if needed to help thin out the frosting and ensure that the dates are completely broken down. I use some of the remaining liquid from the can of coconut milk, but water will work, too. For a sweeter frosting, you can use maple syrup as the liquid, instead. Be sure to taste as you go and adjust the flavor to your liking.
4. Transfer the blended frosting to an airtight storage container and let it set in the fridge for at least 4 hours, or overnight. It will thicken as it chills, and then you can use it to frost your favorite cake or cupcakes.
5. This frosting can be stored in the fridge for up to a week, or you can freeze it for up to 3 months. (It turns into a thick ice cream when you freeze it!)
