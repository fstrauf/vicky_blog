## Ingredients


### Dough

- 380 g wholemeal flour
- 5 g fine salt
- 170 g cubed, cold butter
- 130 g cold water or milk
- _Optional tenderness: 10 g vinegar or lemon juice - softens without adding flavour_
- _Optional pliability: 10 g neutral oil - improves flexibility_
- 1 egg for eggwash
- _3 cups all-purpose flour_
- _¼ to 1/2 teaspoon salt_
- _6 oz unsalted butter (1 stick of butter = 4 oz)_
- _1 egg_
- _1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of water or milk adjust as needed to obtain a soft and smooth dough_

### Filling

- **Bacon, (leftover) potato & cheese:** Dice and pan-fry 250 g waxy potato until tender and golden. Mix with 150 g cheese and 150–200 g chopped bacon. Add sour cream to bind.
- **Spinach, bacon & feta:** Wilt 200 g spinach, squeeze dry, mix with 150 g bacon and 120 g feta.
- **Beef**: beef ragout with onions, garlic and cheese

## Instructions

1. Mix dry: In a bowl, combine flour and salt.
2. Cut in butter: Rub or pulse in the cold butter until the mixture looks like sandy crumbs with a few pea-sized bits.
3. Bind: Add the egg, optional vinegar/lemon, and 130 g cold water/milk. Mix just until a dough forms. If dry or cracking, add liquid a tablespoon at a time until smooth and lightly tacky (not sticky).
4. Rest: Wrap and chill for 60 minutes to hydrate the bran.
5. Roll: Lightly flour the surface. Roll to 3–3.5 mm. If edges crack, let the dough warm 5 minutes and continue.
6. Cut & fill: Cut 10–12 cm rounds. Add 40–50 g filling per empanada. Moisten edges, fold, and crimp well.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmz9yrda2Sk&t=147s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmz9yrda2Sk&t=147s)
7. For best results: after assembling, freeze unbaked empanadas on a tray for **20–30 minutes** until firm, then bake straight from cold. Brush with egg wash just before baking.
8. Cook:
    - Bake: 200°C for 22–26 minutes, until golden.
    - Fry: 175°C oil for 3–4 minutes, until golden.
